    <h2 style="color: white;">This page is dedicated to General Help with DLB, for diagnosing problems and a mini-index to the Command Help sections</h2>
    <br>
    <p style="color: wheat;">Commom Questions:<br>'Where does DLB show user level up's?'<br>DLB sends messages in a channel called 'levels'.
        If one doesn't exist, it will create one, but with basic permissions handled.<br>'How long does it take to cumulate coins and XP?'<br>
        Coins and XP are automatically given to users every 60 seconds. The amount of coins given is a random interger between 1-5, while the amount of XP is a random interger between 25-35.<br>
        'How do I gain more coins and XP?'<br>DLB provides a 'biz'. A biz is a business you can buy, that doubles your income. The more biz's you buy, the more income you'll get. 
        Pretty simple really, buy a biz, get double the coins and XP.</p>
