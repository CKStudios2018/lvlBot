    <p style="color: wheat;">Commom Questions:<br>'Where does DLB show user level up's?'<br>DLB sends messages in a channel called 'Levels' (caution: Capital L).
        If one doesn't exist, it will create one, but with basic permissions handled.<br>'How long does it take to cumulate coins and XP?'<br>
        Coins and XP are automatically given to users every 60 seconds. The amount of coins given is a random interger between 1-5, while the amount of XP is a random interger between 25-35.</p>
